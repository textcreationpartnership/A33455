            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is the Office of Revealing the Will of God, and the Means of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his Church, in all Ages. As,</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>1ſt.</hi> Outwardly, By the Miniſtry of his Word:</p>
                  <q>Chriſt was put to death concerning the<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 18.</note> fleſh, but was quickened in the ſpirit. By which ſpirit he went and preached<note place="margin">—Ver. 19.</note> unto the ſpirits that were in priſon.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly.</hi> Inwardly, By the Operation and Teaching of his holy Spirit: As by the Example of <hi>Lydia,</hi>

                  <q>Whoſe heart the Lord opened, that ſhe<note place="margin">Act. 16. 14.</note> attended unto the things which Paul ſpake.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is that whereby Chriſt hath and doth reconcile God to his Elect: He performing all thoſe things to God for them, whereby they may come to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life:</p>
                  <q>But this man, becauſe he endureth for <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 24.</note> ever, hath an everlaſting prieſthood. Wherefore he is able alſo perfectly to <note place="margin">—Ver. 25.</note> ſave them that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them.</q>
                  <p>Which Prieſtly Office Chriſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms Three ways, for God cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen.</p>

                  <q>He is made unto us, of God, wiſdom, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 30.</note> righteouſneſs, ſanctification and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
                  <p>ſtandeth in Two things:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1ſt.</hi> In the Purity of his Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; he being conceived and born Pure and Holy, void of all Sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly.</hi> In the Obedience of his whole Life; he doing all that the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him for God's Choſen:</p>
                  <q>Who did no ſin, neither was there any <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 22. Iſa 53. 9.</note> guile found in his mouth.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> As he was Man, conſiſting of Body and Soul:</p>
                  <q>Yet the Lord would break him, and <note place="margin">Iſa. 53 10.</note> make him ſubject to infirmities, when he ſhall make his ſoul an offering for ſin.</q>
                  <p>Offering of himſelf unto God his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a ſacrifice without ſpot, thereby appeaſing his Wrath for all their Sins:</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>How much more ſhall the blood of <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 14.</note> Chriſt, which, through the eternal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, offered himſelf without ſpot to God.</p>
                     <p>But now, in the end of the world, hath <note place="margin">—Ver. 26.</note> he appeared once, to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> His entring into Heaven, and there appearing before his Father, continually making Interceſſion for all the Faithful:</p>
                  <q>Who ſhall condemn? It is Chriſt, who <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 34.</note> alſo is at the right hand of God, and maketh requeſt for us.</q>
                  <p>Q. <hi>After what manner doth Chriſt make Interceſſion in Heaven for the Faithful?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Not by Proſtrating himſelf, and uttering Words to his Father; or by putting up a Prayer or Supplication to him:</p>
                  <p>But by preſenting himſelf, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43897:22"/> of himſelf once offered upon the Croſs, and the infinite and unva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Merit of that Sacrifice before the Eyes of his Father: willing, as he is God and Man; and deſiring, as he is Man, that his Father would accept of his perfect Satisfaction for all that are given unto him:</p>
                  <q>For Chriſt is not enter'd into the holy <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 24.</note> places that are made with hands, which are ſimilitudes of the true ſanctuary; but is entred into the very heaven, to appear now in the ſight of God for us.</q>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the Kingly Office of Chriſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is that whereby Chriſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth the Power given him of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther over all Things; diſtributing his Gifts, and diſpoſing of all things for the Good of God's Choſen:</p>
                  <q>All power is given to me, both in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <note place="margin">Mat. 28. 18.</note> and in earth.</q>
                  <p>Which Office Chriſt performs Two ways:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1st.</hi> In the Spiritual Government of his Church: which ſtands partly in collecting and gathering his Church, and the Members of it, out of the World, and from under the Tyranny of the Devil, Sin, and Death:
<q>Who hath delivered us from the <note place="margin">Col. 1. 13.</note> power of darkneſs, and hath tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43897:22"/> us into the kingdom of his dear Son.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, partly, in keeping it, being col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and gathered in the way unto Eternal Life:</p>
                  <q>The encreaſe of his government and peace ſhall have none end; he ſhall ſit upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to ſtabliſh it with judgment, and with juſtice, from henceforth, and for ever.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly.</hi> In the Deſtruction of his and their Enemies: partly in this World; but moſt fully in the End of this World, in the Day of Judgment:</p>
                  <q>Then ſhall the wicked man be revealed; <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2. 8.</note> whom the Lord ſhall conſume with the ſpirit of his mouth, and ſhall aboliſh with the brightneſs of his coming.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> By being made ours. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they ſhall no way help us, to the ſatisfying of God's Juſtice; even as other Mens Riches avail nothing, to deliver us out of Debt, except they become ours.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How therefore may his Gifts and Benefits be made ours?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> If we be made one with him. For by the Benefit of that Union, we are made Partakers of all his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Graces and Riches; which are no leſs imputed unto us before God, than if they were ours by Nature: For this cauſe, ſaith the Apoſtle,</p>
                  <q>That we are by Chriſt reconciled, in<note place="margin">Col. 1. 22.</note> the body of his fleſh through death, to make you holy and unblameable, and without fault in his ſight.</q>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Can no Man therefore be a Partaker of Chriſt's Gifts, except he be made one with him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> He cannot: even as a Woman cannot be a Partaker of the Riches and Honour of ſome Great Man, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſhe be joyned with him in Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, ſo that they become one Body, and one Fleſh: The Members alſo cannot draw Life from the Head, if they be not joyned with it. Therefore there is no true partaking of Chriſt, except
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43897:23"/> there be an Union with him. For this cauſe, Chriſt ſaith,</p>
                  <q>Except ye eat the fleſh of the ſon of<note place="margin">Joh. 6. 53.</note> man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> As many as are United to Chriſt, are Incorporated, and made Members of that Myſtical Body whereof Chriſt is the Head: As St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,</p>

                  <p>Q. <hi>What manner of Union is it, whereby we are joyned and made one with Chriſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Our Incorporation into Chriſt, and Union with him, is a great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery: As St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> And not any way Corporeal, but Spiritual: For,</p>
                  <q>He that is joyned with the Lord, is one<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 17.</note> ſpirit.</q>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How are we to conceive of that Myſtical Union with Chriſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Thus: That our Myſtical Union with him, is a moſt near and real Union:
<q>For as the body is one, and hath many<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 12.</note> members, and all the members of the

                  </p>
                  <p>And that our whole Perſon, Body and Soul, are united to the Body and Soul of Chriſt: ſo that we are Members of his Body, of his Fleſh, and of his Bones<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For,</p>
                  <q>Know you not that your bodies are the members of Chriſt; and that we are members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones.</q>

                  <p>Q. <hi>Did not Chriſt totally deſcend into</hi> Limbo, <hi>or, into the Pit of Hell? (according to the Opinion of many, who alſo will all edge Scripture for it?)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> If Chriſt deſcended locally into Hell, he deſcended as touching his Godhead, his Soul, or his Body.</p>
                  <p>He did not, as touching his Godhead; for that is every where preſent.</p>
                  <p>Nor, as touching his Body; for that reſted in the Grave three Days.</p>
                  <p>Nor, as touching his Soul; becauſe Chriſt ſaid of his Soul,</p>
                  <q>Father, into thy hands I commend my <note place="margin">Luk. 23. 46.</note> ſpirit.</q>
                  <p>Therefore the Soul of Chriſt, after
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:43897:39"/> his Death, was in the hands of his Father, in Paradiſe, and not in Hell.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Seeing then, Chriſt deſcended not into Hell locally, what then is the true meaning of theſe Words?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Namely,</hi> That Chriſt endured, in his Humane Soul, the Senſe of the fierce Wrath of God, due for Man's Sins, partly in the Garden, and partly on the Croſs, when he ſaid,</p>
                  <q>My God! My God! Why haſt thou forſaken me?</q>
                  <p>The which intollerable ſenſe of God's Wrath, is commonly called in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by a Metaphor, <hi>Grief,</hi> or, <hi>Pain of Hell.</hi> Not becauſe the ſelf-ſame in kind; for Chriſt was not utterly For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, nor eternally Damned, nor Tormented in Body with that Fire wherewith the Reprobates ſhall be Tormented for ever:</p>
                  <p>But this Senſe of the fierce Wrath of God, is called the <hi>Sorrows of Hell,</hi> or, a <hi>deſcending into Hell;</hi> becauſe it was nothing inferiour, for the time it laſted, to the very Torments of Hell it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How is this proved, That Chriſt ſuffered in Soul, as well as in Body?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is expreſsly proved, out of

                     <hi>A.</hi> The Efficient and Motive Cauſe of our Election, is, the good Pleaſure of God, who hath not fore-ſeen any thing in us, for which he ſhould chuſe us: for there can be no good thing in us, as of our ſelves, ſeeing we are by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the Children of Wrath, as well as others.</p>
                  <p>So likewiſe the Efficient Cauſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, is the moſt free, good Pleaſure of God: for we being all by Nature the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Wrath, had all periſhed, if Sin were the Cauſe of Reprobation; wherefore the Cauſe of Reprobation is not in Men themſelves, but that is in God's Will, in ſhewing forth his Juſtice. Therefore, of particular Men, why this Man is elected, and he reprobated, there can be no other Reaſon given, but the good Pleaſure of God only. But the Cauſe of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is altogether in Men, which is Sin:</p>

                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:43897:56"/>He hath mercy on whom he will; and<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 12.</note> whom he will, he hardneth.</q>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Is Predeſtination Vnchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or no?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Predeſtination is Firm and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable: which may appear by this Reaſon; Becauſe God is Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, and doth not depend on the Interchangeable Courſe of Things, but the ſame rather dependeth on his Decree.</p>
                  <p>What therefore he hath from Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting decreed, of Saving the Elect, and Condemning the Reprobate, that hath he unchangeably decreed:</p>
                  <p>And therefore both Election and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation is Firm and Unchangeable:</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>This is the Father's will, That of all<note place="margin">Joh. 6. 36.</note> which he hath given me, I ſhould loſe nothing.</p>

                  <p>Q. <hi>Whether are the Elect always Members of the Church?</hi>

                  <p>But the Reprobate and Hypocrite do, at length, finally depart from the Church; and fall away from Goſpel-Gifts and Graces, which they ſeemed to have:</p>
                  <q>They went out from us, but they<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 19.</note> were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us.</q>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Remiſſion of Sins, is, the free Gift of God, whereby the Elect are freed both from the Guiltineſs and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sin, by the means of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Interceſſion of Chriſt, and that in this World.</p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:43897:60"/>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Who is it that giveth Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Sins?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Remiſſion of Sins is given of God only:</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>I, even I am he that putteth away<note place="margin">Iſa. 43. 25.</note> thine iniquities, for my own ſake, and will not remember your ſins.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>And it muſt needs be ſo; becauſe Sin is only committed againſt God, and therefore God only hath Power to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give it.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>But Remiſſion is aſcribed to the Apoſtles, and the Miniſters; as is manifeſt,</hi> Mat. 18. Joh. 20. 23.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Apoſtles remit Sins, in that they are Signifiers and Declarers of God's Remiſſion.</p>
                  <p>The Church remitteth Sins, when, according to the Commandment of God, ſhe denounceth Remiſſion of Sins to the Repentant.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Albeit God remitteth not our Sins unto us, except a moſt ſufficient Price or Puniſhment be firſt paid for them; yet he remitteth them freely unto us, for Chriſt's ſake.</p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:43897:60"/>
                  <p>Q. <hi>But Chriſt did Merit Remiſſion, therefore Remiſſion is not Free?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It was God's Free Grace to give Chriſt unto us; and therefore whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever cometh by Chriſt, cometh freely.</p>

                     <p>It pleaſed the Father, that in Chriſt<note place="margin">Col. 1. 19, 20.</note> ſhould all fulneſs dwell; and by him, to reconcile all things to himſelf; and to ſet at peace, through the blood of his croſs, both the things in earth, and things in heaven.</p>

                  <p>But how are they guilty? Not as principal Actors and Doers in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, (for ſo the Jews were only guilty,) but as Acceſſaries and Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. 'Tis a ſlighting of Chriſt's Death; a not laying of it to heart in a due manner. It implies, that we, in the ſecret of our Souls, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the putting of Chriſt to Death, was no ſuch heinous Offence; when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we can behold the viſible Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it in the Sacrament, without
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:43897:66"/> being at all affected with it; as if Chriſt had been a guilty Perſon, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving to be uſed as he was; and the Jews had done an Act of Juſtice, in Crucifying him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. 'Tis an Injury and Abuſe, that reflects upon the Perſon of Chriſt; as he that ſhall violate the Picture, Seal, or Arms of a King, offers an Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to the King himſelf, and ſhall be puniſh'd accordingly: ſo he that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily uſeth this Sacrament, or Memorial of Chriſt's Death, doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Contempt unto the Death it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. 'Tis a ſign we do not lay to heart the Sin of our Nature, which was the occaſion of Chriſt's Dying. If Man had not ſinned, Chriſt had not died.—And therefore the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> tells us, That <hi>he was wounded for our</hi>

                     <hi>and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.</hi> Hence it is, that in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament we ſhould exerciſe Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; we ſhould <hi>look upon him whom</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis a Tradition, That if the guilty Murtherer be brought to the ſight of the Party murthered, or touch his

                  <p n="4">4. 'Tis a fruſtrating of the End of Chriſt's Death; and as to their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, a ſhedding of the Blood of Chriſt in vain. Chriſt gave his Body to be crucified, and ſuffered his Blood to be ſhed, that he might nouriſh and preſerve the Souls of the Faithful unto Everlaſting Life. Hence it is, that he ſays, that his <hi>Fleſh</hi> is <hi>Meat indeed,</hi> and his <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 55.</note> 
                     <hi>Blood</hi> is <hi>Drink indeed.</hi> But to whom is it ſuch? To thoſe that feed on him by Faith. This was the End why Chriſt gave himſelf, that he might become the Bread of Life. But ſo cannot unworthy Receivers; and therefore the End of Chriſt's giving himſelf, as to them, is utterly fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated and diſappointed; and ſo they become guilty of the Body and Blood, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the Death of Chriſt; are interpretatively, and in effect,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:43897:67"/> Chriſt's Murtherers and Deſtroyers.</p>
                  <p>Now 'tis a fearful thing to be guilty of any Man's Blood; yea, of a wicked Man's Blood: how much more, to be guilty of the Blood of the Son of God! of the Blood of God! <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me, O God, from bloodguiltineſs</hi> (ſays <hi>David.</hi>) It was a Sin, the guilt whereof <note place="margin">Pſal. 51.</note> lay exceeding heavy, yea, like a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of Lead, upon his Spirit.</p>
                  <p>'Tis an heavy thing, to have an hand in Man's Blood; nay, in a wicked Man's Blood. What a fearful Imprecation was that upon <hi>Joab,</hi> for the Blood of <hi>Abner,</hi> who was none of the beſt: <hi>Let the blood of Abner, the</hi>

                     <hi>things than the blood of Abel.</hi>—But if we make our ſelves <hi>guilty</hi> of it, by coming unworthily and unpreparedly to the Sacrament, it ſpeaks no better things than the Blood of <hi>Abel:</hi> It then ſpeaks and cries as <hi>Abel</hi>'s Blood did, for Juſtice and Vengeance.</p>

And we know the Severity of this Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that neglected to come to that Supper of the King, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 5, 7.) And to be without the Sacrament, and without Chriſt, and without God in the World, are joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:43897:72"/> (<hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 11, 12.) Whil'ſt they were called <hi>Uncircumciſion, i. e.</hi> without God's Sacraments, they were without Chriſt, and without God in the World.</p>
                     <p>And the Neceſſity of the Uſe of the Sacraments, appears by this, That before the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> muſt enter into <hi>Canaan,</hi> they muſt be circumciſed, and eat the Paſſover, (<hi>Joſh.</hi> 5. 7, 10.) To teach, That all that will enter into the <hi>heavenly Canaan,</hi> muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, in Obedience to God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, be Partakers of his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It is very dangerous there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to neglect the Sacraments.</p>
                     <p>And yet as dangerous as it is, not to come to the Sacrament; yet it is no leſs dangerous to come, if we come unpreparedly. Unprepared coming, is as dangerous as not coming at all.</p>
                     <p>It is with this Supper in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as it was with that Supper of the King's, in the Parable, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 22.)

                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:43897:72"/>
                     <p>Now, ſhall Men be puniſh'd for not coming, and for coming too? this ſeems to be an hard caſe: (I am in a very great Streight, may many a poor Creature ſay, that begins to be convinced of the greatneſs of the Sin of neglecting ſo holy and uſeful an Ordinance of God, and of the unworthy and unprepared coming to it:) Yes, ſurely; if Men come not as they ſhould, their coming will not ſerve the turn. Mark that Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>Friend, how cameſt thou in hither?</hi>

                     <p>So it is in the Supper of the Lord: A Man commits as great a Sin, in an unprepared coming, as in a profane not coming at all: He may expoſe himſelf to as great a danger by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as by not coming.</p>
                     <p>There is no Man that comes to the Sacrament, but God hath an Eye upon him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     <p>We come to the Sacrament, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of God, to ſeek his Face and Favour, to receive Comfort and Conſolation from him. But whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever comes unpreparedly, inſtead of a gracious Anſwer, ſhall meet with an angry Queſtion, <hi>Friend, how cameſt thou in hither?</hi> A Queſtion, that put thoroughly home to the Conſcience; of Men, will ſo aſtoniſh and affright 'em, that they ſhall not be able to ſay a Word for themſelves.</p>
                     <p>People, generally, will not endure that their Miniſter ſhould Catechiſe them, and Queſtion with them, to prepare them the better for the Holy Sacrament: But let ſuch know, God Himſelf will Catechiſe them; and put ſuch a Queſtion to them, as ſhall ſtrike them dumb and ſpeechleſs.</p>
                     <p>Now is it thus, That it is the Duty of all ſuch as deſire to be made Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Holy Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, are ſolemnly to ſit and prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for it by Examination? and that ſuch as come unpreparedly, come unworthily?

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Actual Preparation</hi> ſtands, in the exciting and awakening of thoſe Graces and Diſpoſitions, and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them when a Man is to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. Both theſe muſt be done by him that will Receive worthily. For there is a Two-fold Unworthineſs found in thoſe that come unprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly to the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper; an Unworthineſs of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, an Unworthineſs of the Action: when ſuch come to the Sacrament, as have no Right to the Sacrament; or when ſuch as have Right to it, come not in a right and due manner. It is in this Ordinance, as in the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word.</p>
                     <p>A Man that will Preach the Word, muſt firſt be habitually prepared for the Work, by having ſuch Gifts, Graces, Abilities, and Miniſterial Qualifications of Learning and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Scriptures, as are required to accompliſh and fit a Man for that Work: A Miniſter ſhould be a Man well read, and well ſtudied.</p>
                     <p>Now, though a Man be ſufficiently qualified, and proved and gifted for the Work of the Miniſtry, he will not on a ſudden ſtep up into the Pulpit,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:43897:74"/> take a Text at adventure, and fall a Preaching; but, beſides his Habitual Preparation in the courſe of his Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, he will ſtudy a freſh upon a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Text, and for a particular Sermon, and beſtow ſpecial Pains for that particular Work.</p>

                     <p>Now, Chriſtians, How hath the Caſe been with you? What Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience have you had of theſe work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? Did you ever ſee your ſelves to be loſt and undone Creatures? Was the News of a Saviour ever as
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:43897:75"/> welcome and acceptable to you, as a Pardon to a ppor Malefactor ready to be turn'd off the Ladder? What longings, thirſtings after Chriſt? Have you beſieged Heaven with ſtrong and earneſt Cries and Groans after Chriſt? Hath the Kingdom of Heaven ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Violence by reaſon of you? Hath Chriſt been ever precious in your eſteem? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. But, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider how Faith works; what the Fruits and Effects of it are; and by that judge: It purifies the Heart; it begets a ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving againſt, and reſiſting of Sin and Corruption; it draws the Heart to a Dependance upon God in all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates and Conditions; it truſts God, as well for a ſupply of Outward Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, as for Eternal Salvation it ſelf.—And (which I ſhall only inſiſt upon) it cauſeth a Man to have reſpect unto all God's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to yield univerſal Obedience, without Diſpenſation. A True Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever doth not allow himſelf in the Omiſſion of any known Duty, or in the Commiſſion of any known Sin: If he do ſin, 'tis out of Weekneſs and Infirmity, or through Violence, and Suddenneſs of Temptation; but 'tis not out of Wilfulneſs and Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:43897:75"/> He may fall into Sin, but he doth not live and lie in the Practice of Sin; he doth not make a Trade of it. Judge therefore how the Caſe ſtands with you in this reſpect:—Are all, or any of God's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments grievous to you? Do you make a trade of Lying, Swearing, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Profaning God's Day, Scoffing at Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh! 'tis to be feared, you are far from Believing, and ſo cannot partake worthily of this Ordinance.</p>
                     <p>A Second Grace, is, <hi>Repentance:</hi> Which may be deſcribed to be a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Sorrow for Sin, joyned with a true Hatred and Deteſtation of it. It implies,</p>

                        <hi>1st.</hi> A Conviction and Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sin.

Amendment and Reformation of Life, is the great Fruit, Evidence and Effect of true Repentance. He that confeſſeth Sin, profeſſeth Sorrow for Sin, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of Sin, and yet continueth in the Practice of Sin: He that by his Practice licks up thoſe Sins, which he ſeemed to have vomited up by Confeſſion, there are ſeven Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations in his Heart; he may ſeem to repent, he may think he repents; but the truth is, he deceiveth himſelf and others. For 'tis Reformation, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of Life, that crowns Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that argues it to be ſound and <note place="margin">Iſa. 1. 16.</note> ſincere. <hi>Waſh you, make ye clean, put away

                     <p>Examine therefore thy ſelf upon this Point. Do'ſt thou, with <hi>Adam,</hi> ſeek to hide thy Sin? Do'ſt thou deny it? extenuate it? excuſe it? juſtifie it? Or, though thou confeſſeſt it in thy Mouth, yet is there a ſecret love and liking to it in thy Heart? Do'ſt thou roul it under thy tongue, as a ſweet Morſel? Is it with thee, as St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> confeſſeth it was with him, before his Converſion? he prayed, That God would be pleaſed to ſuppreſs and ſubdue in him the Luſts of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence; and yet he was afraid God ſhould hear his Prayers, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the ſecret liking he had of thoſe Luſts. Is there no Amendment and Reformation of thy Life, but thou art as vile, as wretched, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and ungodly, as hypocritical and deceitful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as ever? Alas! thou dwelleſt far from Repentance: <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> and <hi>Cain,</hi> and many that are now in the Pit of Deſtruction (for ought I know) have repented as much as that came to.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They that would come worthily to the Lord's Table, muſt
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:43897:77"/> examine themſelves in point of Love and Charity, whether this Grace be in them of a truth, yea, or not.</p>
                     <p>Now, Love is an Affection of the Heart, whereby we wiſh Good to our Neighbour, as to our ſelves; and are willing, in what we are able, to do him that Good we would have done to our ſelves in his Caſe.</p>
                     <p>Now, this Love is to be conſidered, either as reſpecting the Godly, or as it reſpects all Men in general.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Love to the Godly, is then right and ſincere, when 'tis to all that fear God, Poor as well as Rich, Low as well as High, Mean as well as Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; when we have reſpect to him that is clad in <hi>vile Raiment,</hi> as well <note place="margin">Jam. 2. 2, 3</note> as to him that wears the <hi>Gold Ring,</hi> and is arrayed in <hi>goodly Apparel,</hi> (as St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks.)—He truly loves a righteous Man, in the Name of a righteous Man, that loves him becauſe he is ſuch; that can place his Affection where God hath placed his; that can love a Saint, though he be poor, mean and contemptible in the eſteem of the World.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Love to the Godly is then right and ſincere, when 'tis conſtant at all times, as well in Adverſity as Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: He truly loves Chriſt, that will

Art thou ſo far from envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and repining at him (a thing too common in the World now a-days) that it doth thee good to ſee him thrive and proſper? This is an argument of true Love and Charity. But, it may be, thou haſt no Bowels of Pity and Compaſſion towards thy Brother in Miſery; thou ſhutteſt up thine Heart, and withdraweſt thy Hand from him: It may be thou art
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:43897:78"/> one that envieſt and repineſt at the Proſperity of thy Neighbour; thou art lean, becauſe he's fat; thine Eye is evil towards him, becauſe God is good to him: Oh! thou art an uncharitable Wretch! And how dwelleſt the Love of God in thee, when thou haſt no Love to thy Brethren?</p>
                     <p>A Second Note of True Charity, is, when a Man is willing and ready to pardon and remit Offences done unto him; and to ſeek Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion where he hath given Offence.—Indeed, this is a very hard Matter to put in practice, Mens Hearts are ſo full of Pride, Scorn, Rancour, Malice and Revenge.—But a truly Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Man will do for Man, as God hath done for him, who hath freely pardoned him for greater Offences; and though he were the offended Party, yet firſt ſought Reconciliation with him. And therefore, how far are thoſe implacable, revengeful, and irreconcilable Spirits, who know not how to pardon an Offence, or to paſs by an injury; but, <hi>Aeternum ſervant ſub pectore vulnus,</hi> carry an everlaſting Grudge with them; will watch an Opportunity of Revenge, though it may be ſeven Years hence?

                     <p>'Tis with the Sacrament, as with the Word. Many a Man hears the Word, and, in ſome meaſure, minds it; but for the preſent, it hath no Effect at all.

                     <p>It's a great fault in us, when we come from the Sacrament, that we have no care to keep our Hearts in good frame, by Prayer, Meditation, or good Conference, but preſently fall a diſcourſing about ſecular Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or fooliſh, idle and unprofitable
